# Rice and Beans
we beantownin and we bashin ğŸ’€

Boomer rhythm shooter made for the beantown bash hackathon 4/1/2023
(april fools, what did u expect tbh)

engine from https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game 


Original textures (mostly) ğŸ¤¨, music, rhythm beats, creative nature, and general gaming by:
Liam Harlan, Derek Johnson, Alex Kuang, Maykl Yakubovsky ğŸ’¯ğŸ’¯ğŸ’¯ğŸ’¯

If you intent to use this god forsaken program, WASD moves your bean thrower, while left and right arrow keys turn your view. Space throws beans, its supposed to only work on the beat but its like 170 BPM so you can be deaf and win.

also import keyboard and stuff like random and whatever else it asks for duh
